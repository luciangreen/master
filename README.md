Program-Finder-from-Data-
https://github.com/luciangreen/Program-Finder-from-Data-
Finds recursive algorithms from the structure of data.

Mind Reader
https://github.com/luciangreen/mindreader
Contains Prolog programs that can be used by an individual to read their mind using meditation

List Prolog Interpreter
https://github.com/luciangreen/listprologinterpreter/tree/master

Combination Algorithm Writer (with Predicates)
https://github.com/luciangreen/Combination-Algorithm-Writer-with-Predicates
Writes algorithms (with predicates) by calling parts of other algorithms.

Cultural Translation Tool
https://github.com/luciangreen/culturaltranslationtool
CTT gives better translations (and can be modified to give back translations, the translation back into the original language).
